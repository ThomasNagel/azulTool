DESCRIPTION:
This tool runs multiple games and displays some nice statistics

This tool uses multiprocessing to run multiple games at the same time. CPU might get hot :/
Each runner.jar process stores its data in a file. If you see a lot of files being made don't panic, the tool will clean the mess up later.


HOW TO USE:
Make sure that both python scripts are in the same directory as the runner.jar file and the bot files
Have python installed

- run azulAnalyzer.py
- wait a little bit
- done


DISCLAIMER:
This is a random tool I made, I'm not a professional so use at own risk.
